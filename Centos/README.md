## Introduction
This document will list on how to install Faveo Helpdesk on a new CentOS server.

We will install following dependencies in order to make Faveo Helpdesk work
* Apache
* PHP 7.1
* PHP Extensions: listed in [server requirement](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk/wiki/Server-Requirements)
* MySQL/MariaDB
* Composer
* Cron Job

Read the detailed list of [server requirement](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk/wiki/Server-Requirements)

We are using vi editor throughout to open and edit file, you can use nano editor also

## Configure IP Tables
Please note that you have to make changes in the iptables configurations. This allows to open ports that are necessary in Faveo installation.

This is an **optional step**, If you are able to access your server remotely on Public IP. This step will not be required. Mainly on local network server this step is required. If you are purchasing/renting server in a data center this step might not be required.

```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 22 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```

**PS:**
* You have to reset the firewall and iptables to your specifications
* This step might vary for different data centres or cloud service providers, Please check with your hosting company on opening port number and correct settings

## Download EPEL keys
```
rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

rpm -Uvh https://mirror.webtatic.com/yum/el7/webtatic-release.rpm
```

## Update Yum
```
yum update -y
```

In this step we install following

* PHP and Extensions
* MariaDB
* Git
* Curl
* Openssl

## Start Installation
```
yum install -y git curl openssl httpd 

yum install -y  php71w-cli.x86_64 php71w-common.x86_64 php71w-fpm.x86_64 php71w-gd.x86_64 php71w-mbstring.x86_64 php71w-mcrypt.x86_64 php71w-mysql.x86_64 php71w-odbc.x86_64 php71w-pdo.x86_64 php71w-xml.x86_64 mod_php71w php71w-opcache php71w-imap.x86_64 php71w-bcmath.x86_64                                                                            
```
### Start Apache service
```
systemctl start httpd
```
You can do a spot check right away to verify that everything went as planned by visiting your server's public IP address in your web browser (see the note under the next heading to find out what your public IP address is if you do not have this information already):
```
http://your_server_IP_address/
```
You will see the default CentOS 7 Apache web page, which is there for informational and testing purposes. It should look something like this:

![Httpd default page](https://faveohelpdesk.com/user-manual/images/faveoinstallation-centos7-apache/Httpd%20default%20page.jpg)

If you are able to see this default page then continue to next step. If not review your basic server settings again


### Install,Start Mysql and Create Database for Faveo
```
yum install -y mariadb-server mariadb

systemctl start mariadb

mysql_secure_installation
```
The prompt will ask you for your current root password. Since you just installed MySQL, you most likely wonâ€™t have one, so leave it blank by pressing enter. Then the prompt will ask you if you want to set a root password. Go ahead and enter Y, and follow the instructions:


![Mysql conf](https://faveohelpdesk.com/user-manual/images/faveoinstallation-centos7-apache/mariadb%20setup.png)


```
mysql -u root -p

CREATE DATABASE faveo;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON faveo.* TO 'faveouser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'faveouserpass';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

quit
```

### Install ionCube Loader

ionCube is not required for Community edition

```
wget http://downloads3.ioncube.com/loader_downloads/ioncube_loaders_lin_x86-64.tar.gz

tar xfz ioncube_loaders_lin_x86-64.tar.gz

ls ioncube

php -i | grep extension_dir
```
Copy the Path for PHP modules according to your php v
```
cp ioncube/ioncube_loader_lin_7.1.so /usr/lib64/php/modules

where /usr/lib64/php/modules/ will be the php module path directory

vi /etc/php.ini
```

Add the below line to php.ini file
```
zend_extension = /usr/lib64/php/modules/ioncube_loader_lin_7.1.so
```
By checking php version we can verify the loader installed version
```
php -v
```

### Install Composer by changing the directory to Faveo folder
```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer

chmod +x /usr/bin/composer
```

## Copy Faveo Helpdesk from Github
Faveo files can be manually uploaded to server or copied from Github, if you have access to Github account then use this step, else follow the next step
Create a folder for Faveo and upload Faveo Help-Desk Community
```
mkdir -p /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk

git clone https://github.com/ladybirdweb/Faveo-Helpdesk-Pro.git /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk

```
## OR Copy Faveo Helpdesk via SSH
Incase you want to upload the Faveo files from your local system to your server and not use Github, then follow this step Download the Faveo zip file from our billing site https://www.faveohelpdesk.com Use a File transferring client like Filezilla, WinSCP to upload the files to our server directory. Open Filezilla and enter the root Credentials of the server and login.

Create a folder for faveo inside that in the path /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk

Now continue the process by logging in back to ssh terminal

### To upload files via SSH

Login to the File directory
```
scp faveo.zip username@destination:/var/www/faveo
```

Once the transfer is completed unzip the faveo.zip file and rename it to faveo-helpdesk.
For unzip tool installation and unzipping you can use the below command
```
yum install -y unzip
```
then
```
unzip faveo.zip
```
### Make sure that you have extracted all the files under that folder /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk/

### Give correct file permission to Faveo files
```
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/faveo/
chown -R apache:apache /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk/
chmod -R 755 /var/www/
chmod -R 755 /var/www/faveo/
chmod -R 755 /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk/
chmod -R 755 /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk/storage/
chmod -R 755 /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk/bootstrap/

systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
```
## Configure Apache
```
vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/faveo-helpdesk.conf
```
Copy the contents below to above file
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName localhost
ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
DocumentRoot /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk/public
<Directory /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk>
AllowOverride All
</Directory>
ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/faveo-error.log
</VirtualHost>
```

Save and exit
 
### Restart Apache service
```
systemctl restart httpd.service
```

## Setup Cron
Path can vary according to your server. This cron is set for every 1 minute fetching.
```
crontab -u apache -e
* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/faveo/faveo-helpdesk/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Restart services
```
service mariadb restart

systemctl restart httpd
```

## Start Installation

Now you can install Faveo via [GUI](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk/wiki/GUI-Install-Wizard) Wizard or [CLI](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk/wiki/Install-Faveo-via-CLI).

You can access Faveo url in the browser

**PS:** 
* You have to reset the firewall and iptables to your specifications
* You need to follow steps yourself to harden the security of your server, server security is not covered in this article
* Redis is recommended for messaging que and improving system performance
* Always use SSL/HTTPS URL for Faveo
